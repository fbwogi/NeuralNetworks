# Neural Networks Final Project

Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a neural network model capable of predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on a patient's medical data. By utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs), we aim to analyze key health indicators and classify patients as either at risk or not at risk for heart disease. This predictive model can aid in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare interventions.
Our motivation for this project stems from the increasing prevalence of heart disease globally and the need for improved predictive tools to assist medical professionals. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and dependent on human expertise, whereas machine learning models can provide quick and reliable risk assessments based on historical patient data. By leveraging ANNs, we aim to improve early detection accuracy, reduce misdiagnosis, and provide a scalable approach for analyzing medical data.
Additionally, this project will help us deepen our understanding of neural networks, feature engineering, and performance evaluation in a healthcare context. Our findings could pave the way for future enhancements, such as incorporating real-time patient monitoring data or integrating the model into a clinical decision support system.
